# Overview
This is the repository for a mod that I could make for Minecraft in the future. I am unsure of what the mod would be currently. However, I would love to add some more variety to the game that would spice up a user's experience. For example, creating new biomes within the game for players to explore. These biomes would have their own unique mobs, trees, other blocks, and materials.
